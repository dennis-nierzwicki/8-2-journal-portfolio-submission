# 8-2 Journal: Portfolio Submission
## The Gaming Room
Our client, The Gaming Room, wanted to expand their current Draw It Or Lose It game as a web-based application to reach more users and expand their reach. Our goals included:
- Designing the server-side system this application would be deployed to.
- Brainstorming how the client-side functions of the software design would work.
- Propose specific OS to handle server-side functions while taking into consideration memory management, performance, storage, RAM and security.
## What Do I Feel I Did Well With?
We began with a high-level overview of how this could work and narrowed down the best course of action moving forward with an OS. I made specific recommendations based on my professional research. I added an alternative solution that may cut down on overhead costs. I provided sources to my recommendations for further reinforcement.
## What Part Of The Design Process Helped While Developing The Code?
We studied several software design applications and understood we wanted to implement the Singleton Pattern. By examining different design patterns first and declaring which would be the most useful, it made implementing it much easier. 
## If I Could Pick One Part Of My Work To Revise, What Would It Be And How Would I Revise It?
I feel like I could have gone into more detail describing security features of my recommendation. Just offering a list of security features doesn't help narrow down which would be the most useful for this specific application.
## How Did I Interpret User's Needs & Why Is This Important?
User research could have been expanded on but, overall, we have to look at this from the perspective of a user with limited network and limited technology if we truely want to expand the game. I made recommendations on image sizes so that the game could run well for a wide variety of users by cutting down on image sizes and introducing compression. This is important for any software design because the user is the front-facing element. If there are user pain-points that aren't addressed, the application won't achieve it's goals of expanding.
## How Did I Approach Designing Software? What Strategies Would I Use In The Future?
At first, I tried "brute force" writing the additional code without truly examining what was in front of me. Sufficeto say, that didn't work well. I had to step back and look at what each piece was doing while taking notes on variables and what they did. Like a pseudo-code/UML type diagram. After seeing the whole picture, it was easier to incorporate the 'puzzle pieces' to achieve what we were going for. I plan on applying this same formula in future projects from the start to save time.
